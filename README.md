# McKesson iForm Ideas

Because I just couldn't leave it alone.

This repo contains some ideas that have been rattling around in my head about how some of the processes related to creating iForms could be improved by using current web development practices and tools.

## Why?

Why does this project exist? Come on, don't delete this part. Fill it.
Yes it's hard, but it's perhaps the most important part of the README.

As to why *this* project exist, it's to serve as a template for future open
source PHP projects. Of course, feel free to fork it and make your own recipe.

## Installation

Describe how to install the project/library/framework/â€¦

Make sure your installation instructions work by testing them!

## Usage

Now let's describe how you can use this project!

For the sake of the example, I will include an unnecessarily explicit code block
because the "Usage" section should contain examples.

So here is how you can use this project as a basis for your own future repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mnapoli/project-template.git my-project
cd my-project
# Remove the git repository metadata
rm -rf .git/
# Start a brand new repository
git init
git add .
```
